# Alfred TimeTracker

Track your time on Google Calendar ðŸ“… using Alfred.

Have you ever asked yourself the question, `What did I do today?`.
If you did and could not answer, this Alfred workflow is for you.
Sometimes we have so many different tasks and interrupt that it is easy to lose track.
You can try to track them manually, but this approach is error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious.
This workflow allows you to leverage Alfred's power to track your work easily.

*Disclaimer*. The workflow is already working, but it is still under construction. Use it at your own risk âš¡.

## Installation

1. Download the latest workflow from the [releases](https://github.com/davidepedranz/timetracker/releases) page
2. Add it to Alfred (double-click is usually enough)
3. Run `tt authorize` & `tt setup`
4. Track your time like a pro ðŸ˜Ž
