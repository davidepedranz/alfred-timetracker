Track your time on Google Calendar ðŸ“… using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

Have you ever asked yourself the question, `What did I do today?`.
If you did and could not answer, this Alfred workflow is for you.
Sometimes we have so many different tasks and interrupt that it is easy to lose track.
You can track them manually, but this approach is error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious.
This workflow lets you to leverage Alfred's power to track your work easily.

## Installation

1. Download the latest workflow from the [releases](https://github.com/davidepedranz/timetracker/releases) page
2. Add it to Alfred (double-click is usually enough)
3. Run `tt authorize` & `tt setup`
4. Track your time like a pro ðŸ˜Ž

## Security

On February. 2022, Google deprecated the use of Loopback IP addresses on the Chrome OAuth client type.
The change forced us to migrate to the Desktop OAuth client type.
Desktop clients require a `client_secret` as part of the OAuth authorization flow, which we need to distribute together as part of the Alfred package.
Without appropriate protection, an attacker able to sniff HTTP requests on the machine might try to intercept the OAuth `code` and exchange it for a valid `access_token`.
This project prevents this and similar attacks by implementing the OAuth [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636).
